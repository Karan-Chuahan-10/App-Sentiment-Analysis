## Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook:**  Used for cleaning and extracting the sentiment from the source code  

- **Microsoft Excel:** Excel is utilized for data preparation tasks such as importing raw data, cleaning and transforming data, and performing preliminary analysis. It provides a familiar and versatile environment for handling structured data efficiently.

- **Power BI:** Power BI is the core tool for building interactive dashboards and visualizations. Leveraging Power BI's robust features, including its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, rich visualization options, and seamless data connectivity, this project delivers a compelling user experience. Power BI enables dynamic filtering, custom visualizations, and real-time insights, empowering users to explore and analyze Cricket World Cup 2023 data comprehensively.

## Approach
- **Approach:**
The approach involves acquiring app review data, cleaning and preprocessing it using Python, and conducting sentiment analysis to classify reviews. With the cleaned data, a sentiment analysis dashboard is created using Power BI, showcasing sentiment trends, average scores, and word clouds for each sentiment category. The dashboard features interactive filtering for exploring sentiment analysis results across different app versions and sentiment categories. Finally, the dashboard is deployed to the Power BI service for online access and sharing with stakeholders, enabling developers to make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and satisfaction.

## Key Features:

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizing Python, the tool classifies reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights into user feedback.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Powered by Power BI, the dashboard offers interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities, enabling users to explore sentiment trends across app versions and sentiment categories.
- **Visualizations:** The dashboard presents sentiment analysis results through visually appealing charts, graphs, and word clouds, facilitating easy interpretation of data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Python is employed for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, ensuring high-quality input data for accurate sentiment analysis.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the dashboard to focus on specific app versions, sentiment categories, or time periods, tailoring the analysis to their needs.

## Benefits:

- **Actionable Insights:** By tracking sentiment trends and identifying patterns in user feedback, developers can make informed decisions to enhance app features and user experience.
- **Improved User Satisfaction:** Addressing issues highlighted by sentiment analysis can lead to improvements in app functionality and usability, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and retention.
- **Efficient Decision-Making:** With a centralized dashboard providing comprehensive sentiment analysis, stakeholders can quickly assess the overall sentiment landscape and prioritize areas for improvement.
- **Enhanced Product Development:** By understanding user sentiments and preferences, developers can iterate on app features and updates, ensuring alignment with user expectations and preferences.
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Leveraging sentiment analysis data enables a data-driven approach to app development, minimizing guesswork and maximizing the impact of development efforts.

## Status
- App Sentiment Analysis **Completed**
